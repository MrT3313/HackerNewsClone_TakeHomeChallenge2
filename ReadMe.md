# Hacker News Clone
This is the second take home challenge given out by Lambda's engineering team.

My main goal of this project is to continue expanding my test capabilities with React Testing Library and Jest. 

## **The Challenge**
Your challenge is to build a read-only clone of the hacker news frontend using that API.
